vite@latest -> to start (in clients side)

cd client -> npm i to install it all router , react

tailwind docs

auto rename tag 

deploy it to github

now we will create pages and routes  (6 pages intotal )
for routes -> router dom 

routes successfully established

to update in github we use source control on vs code
->just click on commit option available there 
1_ click on +
2_ then on arrow and commit and push option

to create header we use flowbite package similar to bootstrap


header successfully added (also comitted to github )

next from we will work on backend work step by step 

from 53 mins
* create and run server


backend should be in the root file out of client 
first npminit -y -> change the type to module (only then these packages will work)
create api folder and then save (index.js) init
we need to install express for backend

to avoid restarting the server when changes are made we use nodemon to autoupdate server 
when changes are made
then change the script to 
 "dev":"nodemon api/index.js",
    "start": "node api/index.js"

to use nodemon npm run dev 

# move gitignore from inside of client to root directory

now connect to database

mongo setup done and connected

create an env file to save the important keys init 
to access key we use process.env.MONGO TO access the key from anywhere

* TO use env npm i"dotenv" ->
next add these
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();
then add .env to gitignore so that it wont be sent 

from 1:13 create a user model for db
api -> model -> user.model.js
